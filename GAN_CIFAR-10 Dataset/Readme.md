I tried to train my GAN Model on CIFAR-10 but it failed terribly with the discriminator accuracy nearly 100% throughout. 
I couldn't figure out why was the model failing so bad, but it did likewise. If there is any flaw in the way I've written my generator/ discriminator code, please share so that I can improve upon this.
