This repository contains all the work done under Seasons of Code conducted by WnCC, IIT Bombay. The project is Why Hype Around GAN's? and was mentored by Akshit Srivastava and Tezan Sahu. 
Yann LeCun described GANs as “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning”. And, indeed, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) have had a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow.
This project involved learning many machine learning algorithms leading to GANs.
